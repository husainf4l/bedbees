# ✅ Publish System Restored & Fixed

## Changes Made (October 11, 2025)

### 1. **Removed "Create Listing" from Sidebar** ❌

- Removed the "Create Listing" navigation item from the left sidebar
- This declutters the navigation and directs users to the proper listing creation flow

### 2. **Kept "Create New Listing" in Business Overview** ✅

- The "Create Listing" button in the Business Overview (Quick Actions) remains intact
- Users can access it from the homepage dashboard

### 3. **Added Publish/Unpublish Buttons to "My Listings"** 🚀

Each listing card now shows:

#### For Accommodations:

- **View** button - See the public listing page
- **Edit** button - Modify the listing details
- **Publish Now** button (if unpublished) - Make the listing live with one click
- **Unpublish** button (if published) - Take the listing offline

#### For Tours:

- **View** button - See the public listing page
- **Edit** button - Modify the listing details
- **Publish Now** button (if unpublished) - Make the listing live with one click
- **Unpublish** button (if published) - Take the listing offline

### 4. **Status Badges** 🏷️

Each listing card now displays its current status:

- **Published** (green badge) - Listing is live and visible to guests
- **Draft** (gray badge) - Listing is saved but not yet published

## How the Publishing System Works

### Backend URLs (Already Working):

- `POST /accommodation/<id>/publish/` - Publishes an accommodation
- `POST /accommodation/<id>/unpublish/` - Unpublishes an accommodation
- `POST /tour/<id>/publish/` - Publishes a tour
- `POST /tour/<id>/unpublish/` - Unpublishes a tour

### What Happens When You Publish:

1. **Click "Publish Now"** on any listing in "My Listings" tab
2. **Backend updates the listing:**
   - Sets `is_published = True`
   - Sets `is_active = True`
   - Sets `published_at` timestamp
   - Changes status to "published"
3. **Success message appears** confirming the listing is live
4. **Listing appears on public site** immediately
5. **Badge changes** from "Draft" to "Published"
6. **Button changes** from "Publish Now" to "Unpublish"

### What Happens When You Unpublish:

1. **Click "Unpublish"** on any published listing
2. **Backend updates:**
   - Sets `is_published = False`
   - Sets `is_active = False`
   - Changes status to "draft"
3. **Listing removed from public site** immediately
4. **Badge changes** from "Published" to "Draft"
5. **Button changes** from "Unpublish" to "Publish Now"

- Success messages appear after publish/unpublish actions
- All changes save immediately to the database
