## 🎬 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### **Scenario: User Creates & Publishes a Listing**

**Step 1**: User goes to Create Accommodation

```
URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/create-accommodation/
```

**Step 2**: User fills out form

```
Property Name: "Luxury Villa Dubai"
Location: "Dubai"  ← User just types this
Property Type: "villa"
Price: $500/night
Photos: 5 uploaded
```

**Step 3**: User clicks "🚀 Publish Now"

**Step 4**: System processes automatically

```
1️⃣ Location Normalization:
   Input: "Dubai"
   Output: "UAE" (standardized)

2️⃣ Validation:
   City: Dubai ✓
   Country: UAE ✓

3️⃣ Categorization:
   Type: Villa
   Category page: /villas/
   Country page: /uae/

4️⃣ Publishing:
   status = "published"
   is_published = True
   is_active = True
   published_at = 2025-10-10 22:36:00

5️⃣ Email Notifications:
   Host: "Your listing is now live!" ✅
   Admin: "New listing published" ✅
```

**Step 5**: User sees success message

```
🎉 SUCCESS! "Luxury Villa Dubai" is now LIVE and published!
✨ Your property is visible in Dubai, UAE.
📍 It appears on:
   • Homepage (featured section)
   • UAE page (/uae/)
   • Villa category page (/villas/)
📧 Confirmation email sent!
```

**Step 6**: Listing appears everywhere

```
✅ Homepage: Shows in "Recent Listings" or "Featured"
✅ UAE Page: Shows with other UAE properties
✅ Villas Page: Shows with other villas
✅ Search Results: Appears when users search "Dubai"
✅ My Listings: Host can manage it
```

## 🌐 Where Listings Appear

When published, listings automatically show on **5 places**:

1. **Homepage** (`/`)

   - Recent listings section
   - Featured properties carousel

2. **Country Page** (`/uae/`, `/jordan/`, etc.)

   - All listings in that country
   - Filtered by location

3. **Category Page** (`/hotels/`, `/villas/`, etc.)

   - All listings of that type
   - Filtered by property_type/tour_category

4. **Search Results**

   - Location-based searches
   - Price range filters
   - Property type filters

5. **My Listings Dashboard**
   - Always visible to host
   - Manage status, edit, delete

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### **1. Enable Moderation** (Optional)

In `core/views_publishing.py`:

```python
MODERATION_ENABLED = True  # Change to enable approval workflow
```

**When Enabled**:

- Listings go to "pending" status
- Admin must approve/reject
- Host receives approval/rejection email
- Listing goes live only after approval

**Default: False** (Direct publishing, instant live)

---

### **2. Add More Locations**

In `core/views_publishing.py`, add to `COUNTRY_MAPPING`:

```python
COUNTRY_MAPPING = {
    # ... existing 40 entries ...
    "new_city": "Country Name",
    "another_city": "Country Name",
}
```
