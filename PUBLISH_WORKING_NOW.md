# 🚀 PUBLISH SYSTEM NOW WORKING! ✅

## Changes Made (October 11, 2025)

### ✅ **FIXED: Publish Now Works on Creation Forms!**

The publish system is now **fully functional** on both creation pages:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/create-accommodation/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/create-tour/`

---

## 🎯 What You'll See Now

### **1. Two Buttons on Final Step:**

#### **"Save as Draft" Button (Gray)**

- Saves your listing without publishing
- Listing is **NOT visible** to guests
- Status: **Draft**
- You can publish it later from "My Listings"

#### **"🚀 Publish Now" Button (Green)**

- **Immediately publishes** your listing
- Listing goes **LIVE instantly**
- Status: **Published**
- **Visible to guests** and ready for bookings!

## 📝 How It Works Now

### **Backend Logic:**

```python
# When form is submitted:
publish_action = request.POST.get("publish_action")

if publish_action == "publish":
    # PUBLISH IMMEDIATELY
    accommodation.is_published = True
    accommodation.is_active = True
    accommodation.status = "published"
    accommodation.published_at = timezone.now()

    messages.success(
        f'🎉 SUCCESS! "{name}" is now LIVE and published! '
        f'Your listing is visible to guests and ready for bookings.'
    )
else:
    # SAVE AS DRAFT
    accommodation.is_published = False
    accommodation.is_active = False
    accommodation.status = "draft"

    messages.success(
        f'✅ "{name}" saved as draft! '
        f'Go to "My Listings" and click "Publish Now" when ready.'
    )
```
