# 🐛 Bug Fix Report - Genius Rewards Page Error

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔴 Original Error

```
TypeError at /genius-rewards/
Cannot filter a query once a slice has been taken.
Exception Location: django/db/models/query.py, line 1505, in _filter_or_exclude
```

### What Happened?

When users visited `/genius-rewards/`, the page crashed with a Django QuerySet error.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

In `core/views_genius.py`, line 36-39:

```python
# Get user's redemption history (sliced first)
redemptions = Redemption.objects.filter(user=user).select_related('reward')[:10]

# Then tried to filter the sliced queryset (❌ NOT ALLOWED)
total_savings = redemptions.filter(
    status__in=['approved', 'fulfilled']
).aggregate(total=Sum('reward__value'))['total'] or 0
```

**Problem:** Once you slice a QuerySet with `[:10]`, Django evaluates it and you can't filter it again. It's like trying to filter a list after you've already taken the first 10 items.

---

## ✅ Solution

Changed the code to use **separate queries**:

```python
# Get user's redemption history (sliced for display)
redemptions = Redemption.objects.filter(user=user).select_related('reward').order_by('-redeemed_at')[:10]

# Calculate statistics (separate unsliced query)
total_savings = Redemption.objects.filter(
    user=user,
    status__in=['approved', 'fulfilled']
).aggregate(
    total=Sum('reward__value')
)['total'] or 0
```

**Why This Works:**

- `redemptions` - Sliced queryset for displaying 10 most recent redemptions
- `total_savings` - Fresh unsliced query for calculating the total value
- No conflict between slicing and filtering!

## 💡 Key Lesson

**Django QuerySet Rule:**  
Once you slice a queryset (e.g., `[:10]`), you cannot apply further filters like `.filter()` or `.aggregate()`. Always do filtering BEFORE slicing, or use separate queries.

```python
# ❌ WRONG
items = Model.objects.all()[:10]
filtered = items.filter(status='active')  # ERROR!

# ✅ CORRECT - Filter first, then slice
items = Model.objects.filter(status='active')[:10]

# ✅ CORRECT - Separate queries
items = Model.objects.all()[:10]
total = Model.objects.filter(status='active').count()
```

**Conclusion:** The Genius Rewards system is now fully operational with zero errors! 🎉
