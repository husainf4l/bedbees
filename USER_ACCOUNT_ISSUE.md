When you create a listing through Django forms, it automatically sets:

```python
listing.host = request.user  # The currently logged-in user
```

So:

- If you were logged in as `shadishadi` when you created it ✅
- The listing belongs to `shadishadi` ✅
- You must be logged in as `shadishadi` to manage it ✅
