## 💻 Code Examples

### Automatic Points Award

```python
# Just change booking status - points awarded automatically!
booking.status = 'completed'
booking.save()
# Signal handles everything ✨
```

### Check User Status

```python
profile = user.genius_profile
print(f"Level: {profile.level_name}")  # "Voyager"
print(f"Points: {profile.total_points}")  # 250
print(f"Value: ${profile.reward_value()}")  # $25.00
print(f"Discount: {profile.discount_percentage}%")  # 10%
```

### Redeem Reward

```python
reward = Reward.objects.get(name='$25 Travel Credit')
success, message = profile.redeem_points(reward)
if success:
    print(f"Success! Code: {message}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {message}")
```
