## 🚀 What You Need to Do

### Add Publish Buttons to Your Dashboard

In `core/templates/core/hostdashboard.html`, find where you list accommodations/tours and add:

```django
<!-- For each accommodation -->
{% for accommodation in accommodations %}
<div class="listing-card">
    <h3>{{ accommodation.property_name }}</h3>
    <p>{{ accommodation.city }}, {{ accommodation.country }}</p>

    <!-- ADD THIS LINE -->
    {% include 'core/components/publish_button.html' with listing=accommodation listing_type='accommodation' %}
</div>
{% endfor %}

<!-- For each tour -->
{% for tour in tours %}
<div class="listing-card">
    <h3>{{ tour.tour_name }}</h3>

    <!-- ADD THIS LINE -->
    {% include 'core/components/publish_button.html' with listing=tour listing_type='tour' %}
</div>
{% endfor %}
```

That's it! The system is ready.

## 📧 Configure Email (Optional)

In `settings.py`, add:

```python
# For development (emails print to console)
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'

# For production (use real SMTP)
# EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
# EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
# EMAIL_PORT = 587
# EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
# EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@example.com'
# EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-password'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'BedBees <noreply@bedbees.com>'
SITE_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000'
```

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Host creates listing** → Status: `draft`
2. **Host clicks "Publish"** → Status: `published` (if no moderation)
3. **Email sent** → Host receives confirmation
4. **Listing appears** → Shows on homepage + country page
5. **Location-based** → Automatically placed by city/country

---

## ⚙️ Enable Moderation (Optional)

In `core/views_publishing.py`, line 20:

```python
MODERATION_ENABLED = True  # Require admin approval
```

---

## 🧪 Test It

1. Go to your dashboard
2. Create a new accommodation
3. Click "Publish Listing" button
4. Check that:
   - Status changes to "Published"
   - Listing appears on homepage
   - Listing appears on country page (e.g., /countries/jordan/)
   - Email confirmation (check console if DEBUG=True)
