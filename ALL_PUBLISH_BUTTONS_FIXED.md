## 📋 Complete Technical Implementation

### Common Pattern Applied to All

#### 1. Form Attribute
```html
<form ... id="contentTypeForm" novalidate>
```

#### 2. Hidden Input (Fallback)
```html
<input type="hidden" name="publish_action" id="publish_action_input" value="draft">
```

#### 3. Two Buttons
```html
<!-- Save as Draft -->
<button type="submit" name="publish_action" value="draft" class="...">
    Save as Draft
</button>

<!-- Publish Now -->
<button type="submit" name="publish_action" value="publish" class="...">
    🚀 Publish Now
</button>
```

#### 4. JavaScript Handler
```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    const form = document.getElementById("contentTypeForm");
    if (form) {
        form.setAttribute('novalidate', 'novalidate');
        
        const publishBtn = document.querySelector('button[name="publish_action"][value="publish"]');
        const publishInput = document.getElementById("publish_action_input");
        
        if (publishBtn && publishInput) {
            publishBtn.addEventListener("click", function() {
                publishInput.value = "publish";
            });
        }
    }
});
```

#### 5. Backend Logic
```python
publish_action = request.POST.get("publish_action", "draft")
if publish_action == "publish":
    item.is_published = True
    item.is_active = True
    item.status = "published"
    item.published_at = timezone.now()
    # ... save and redirect to home
    return redirect("core:home")
else:
    item.is_published = False
    item.is_active = False
    item.status = "draft"
    # ... save and redirect to dashboard
return redirect("core:hostdashboard")
```

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### For All Content Types:

1. **User fills form** → Multi-field creation form
2. **User clicks button:**
   - **"Save as Draft"** → Saves with `is_published=False`, status="draft"
   - **"🚀 Publish Now"** → Saves with `is_published=True`, status="published"
3. **Backend processes:**
   - Sets appropriate flags
   - Saves to database
   - Shows success message
4. **Redirects:**
   - **Draft:** Goes to host dashboard (can edit/publish later)
   - **Publish:** Goes to home page (see it live immediately)
