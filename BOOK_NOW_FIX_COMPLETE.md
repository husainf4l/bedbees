# Book Now Button Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue

The "Book Now" button on accommodation detail pages was redirecting to the homepage instead of showing the booking form.

## Root Cause

The `book_accommodation` view in `core/views.py` only handled demo accommodations (IDs 1-20). When a user tried to book a real database accommodation (like ID 53), the view couldn't find it in the demo list and redirected to the accommodations page.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Extended `book_accommodation` View

Updated `/home/aqlaan/Desktop/bedbees/core/views.py` to handle both demo and database accommodations:

```python
# Find the accommodation by ID - first try demo accommodations
accommodation = None
is_demo = False

for acc in demo_accommodations:
    if str(acc["id"]) == str(id):
        accommodation = acc
        is_demo = True
        break

# If not found in demos, try database
if not accommodation:
    try:
        db_accommodation = Accommodation.objects.get(
            id=id, is_published=True, is_active=True
        )
        # Get location string
        location_parts = []
        if db_accommodation.city:
            location_parts.append(db_accommodation.city)
        if db_accommodation.country:
            location_parts.append(db_accommodation.country)
        location_str = ", ".join(location_parts) if location_parts else "Location not specified"

        # Get first photo if available
        first_photo = AccommodationPhoto.objects.filter(
            accommodation=db_accommodation
        ).order_by('display_order').first()

        image_url = ""
        if first_photo:
            image_url = first_photo.get_image_url()

        # Convert database model to dictionary format
        accommodation = {
            "id": str(db_accommodation.id),
            "name": db_accommodation.property_name,
            "location": location_str,
            "description": db_accommodation.full_description or db_accommodation.tagline or "",
            "price": float(db_accommodation.base_price or 0),
            "currency": "USD",
            "rating": 4.5,
            "reviews": 0,
            "type": db_accommodation.property_type or "accommodation",
            "amenities": db_accommodation.get_amenities_list(),
            "image": image_url,
            "bedrooms": db_accommodation.num_rooms or 1,
            "bathrooms": db_accommodation.num_bathrooms or 1,
            "max_guests": db_accommodation.max_guests or 2,
            "room_type": "Standard Room",
            "cancellation_policy": db_accommodation.cancellation_policy or "Standard cancellation policy",
            "check_in_time": str(db_accommodation.checkin_time) if db_accommodation.checkin_time else "14:00",
            "check_out_time": str(db_accommodation.checkout_time) if db_accommodation.checkout_time else "12:00",
            "property_highlights": [],
        }
        is_demo = False
    except Accommodation.DoesNotExist:
        # If accommodation not found in both demo and database, redirect
        return redirect("core:accommodations")
```

### 2. Field Mapping

Mapped database model fields to the dictionary format expected by the booking template:

| Template Field   | Database Field                  | Fallback                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `location`       | `city` + `country`              | "Location not specified" |
| `description`    | `full_description` or `tagline` | ""                       |
| `price`          | `base_price`                    | 0                        |
| `image`          | First `AccommodationPhoto`      | ""                       |
| `bedrooms`       | `num_rooms`                     | 1                        |
| `bathrooms`      | `num_bathrooms`                 | 1                        |
| `check_in_time`  | `checkin_time`                  | "14:00"                  |
| `check_out_time` | `checkout_time`                 | "12:00"                  |

## Testing Results

### Before Fix:

```bash
$ curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/accommodations/53/book/..."
302  # Redirected to homepage
```

### After Fix:

```bash
$ curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/accommodations/53/book/..."
200  # Booking page loads successfully
```

### Verified Content:

- ✅ Booking form renders with all fields
