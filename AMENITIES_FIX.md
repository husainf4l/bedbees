# 🔧 AMENITIES DISPLAY FIX - COMPLETE

## ❌ The Problem

Amenities were displaying like this:

```
Amenities
[
'
F
r
e
e
W
i
F
i
,
C
a
b
l
e
T
V
...
```

Each character was on a separate line instead of showing amenity names properly.

## 🔍 Root Cause

The template was iterating directly over the `amenities` string:

```django
{% for amenity in accommodation.amenities %}
```

In Python/Django, when you iterate over a string, you get **one character at a time**, not the comma-separated values.

## ✅ The Solution

### 1. Added Method to Model (`core/models.py`)

Added `get_amenities_list()` method to the `Accommodation` model that:

- Parses comma-separated strings properly
- Handles both formats:
  - Normal: `"WiFi,Pool,Spa"`
  - Array format: `"['WiFi,Pool,Spa']"` (from form submissions)
- Returns a clean list of amenities

### 2. Updated Templates

Fixed 3 templates to use the new method:

**✅ `accommodation_detail.html`:**

```django
{% for amenity in accommodation.get_amenities_list %}
```

**✅ `wishlist.html`:**

```django
{% for amenity in item.get_amenities_list %}
```

**✅ `cart.html`:**

```django
{% for amenity in item.get_amenities_list %}
```

## 📊 Testing Results

Before:

```
A
m
e
n
i
t
i
e
s
```

After:

```
✓ Free WiFi
✓ Cable TV
✓ Free Parking
✓ Swimming Pool
✓ Fitness Center
```

## ✅ Status

**Fixed and tested!** Amenities now display properly as:

- Individual items with checkmarks
- Properly formatted text
- Easy to read list

All accommodation pages will now show amenities correctly.
